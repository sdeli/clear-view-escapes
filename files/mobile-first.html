	<p > MOBILE FIRST - CONCEPT

		Websites are built in opposite direction: Mobile View => Tablet View => Desktop View
		-due to the higher traffic comes from mogile devices

		Download website elements specified to viewport - prevent to download data user wont use

		Load as quickly as possible on mobile

		- Experts involver: Information Arcitect, Usability Expert, Graphic Designer

	</p>

	<p> MOBILE FIRST - DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

	<div> <h4>MUST USE TECHNOLGIES</h4>

		<p> RESPONSIVE IMAGE SYSTEM

			Ways of handling images in html:
				- Art Direction and Cropping 
				- Image resolution and file size

			Example - Control over cropping / art direction:

				Example 1
				<picture>
					<source srcset="crop-large.jpg, crop-large-hier-resolution.jpg" media="(min-width: 1200px)">
					<source srcset="crop-medium.jpg, crop-medium-hier-resolution.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)>
					<img src="crop-small.jpg" alt="">
				</picture>

				Example 2
				<picture>
					<img src="assets/images/our-start-portrait-hi-dpi.jpg" alt="">
					<source sizes="404px" srcset="assets/images/our-start.jpg 404w, assets/images/our-start-hi-dpi.jpg 808w" media="(min-width: 1020px)">
					<source sizes="320px" srcset="assets/images/our-start-portrait.jpg 382w, assets/images/our-start-portrait-hi-dpi.jpg 764" media="(min-width: 800px)">
					<img src="assets/images/our-start-landscape.jpg 800w, assets/images/our-start-landscape-hi-dpi.jpg 1600w" alt="Our founder, Jane Doe">
				</picture>  

			Example - Size Controll	- 
				<img srcset="crop-small.jpg 570w, crop-medium.jpg 800w, crop-large.jpg 1200w" alt="">
			

			MAIN CONSEQUENCES:

					- Images need to be cropped according to the breakpoints of the grid
					- Attributes of cropping: 
							- Style of Cropping:
								- mobile: landscape
								- tablet: Portrait
								- Desktop: normal

							- Resolution of cropped image:
								- check examples in travel-site/assets/images

							- Important breakpoints: 
									- min-width: 640px
									- min-width: 800px
									- min-width: 1200px
									- for further check examples

					- Image resolution need to be decraised by tynier displays
